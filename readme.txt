You need to install Pillow for this to work
(pip install Pillow)

It's fairly simple to use:
Get any .jpg file and drag it into the folder
(Try to use smaller files, or it will take a long time, remember, it's exponential)
(16x16=256  32x32=1024  64x64=4096)
Then in pixelart.py, change the string on line 4 to whatever the picture is named.

Note:
Make sure your picture is inside of the same folder as the rest of the program
